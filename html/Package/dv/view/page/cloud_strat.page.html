Cloud computing is becoming a real alternative for companies and governments looking to provide better services while reducing costs.

Today’s infrastructure clouds such as Amazon AWS, Google Apps, and Microsoft Azure, offer a relatively inexpensive and flexible alternative to buying in-house hardware. They are now mature enough for business-critical projects, not just research and development. They are also well suited for computation-intensive jobs such as data cleansing, data mining, risk modeling, optimization and simulation.
