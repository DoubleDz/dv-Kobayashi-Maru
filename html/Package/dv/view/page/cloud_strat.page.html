              <p>DV·mobile Cloud Strategy and Deployment services will help you determine which Cloud is right for you and then help you implement seamless integration between your applications and the Cloud. Cloud computing is becoming a real alternative for companies and governments looking to provide better services while reducing costs.

Today’s infrastructure clouds such as Amazon AWS, Google Apps, and Microsoft Azure, offer a relatively inexpensive and flexible alternative to buying in-house hardware. They are now mature enough for business-critical projects, not just research and development. They are also well suited for computation-intensive jobs such as data cleansing, data mining, risk modeling, optimization and simulation.
